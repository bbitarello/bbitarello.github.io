If you don\u0026rsquo;t wanna read that, no worries. Just skip ahead or get straight to business!\nNow, to the story.\nI have been working on a project where I was using population allelic frequencies for about 6,000 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) for CEU (North Americans from UTAH with European ancestry) individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. We have our own copy of this dataset in our computer, and it\u0026rsquo;s relatively straightforward to get those frequencies from vcf files. All good.\nThen, I decided I should check whether CEU individuals were a good proxy for allelic frequencies in Europeans (excluding Finnish, which due to their interesting demographic history are usually excluded for this kind of analysis). I wanted to do this by comparing the allelic frequencies for CEU from the 1000 Genomes (404 individuals) to the tens of thousands \u0026lsquo;non-Finnish European\u0026rsquo; samples from the the Genome Aggregation Database ( gnomAD). Hence, I went to their website and thought to myself that downloading their entire dataset and calculating allelic frequencies did not strike me as elegant. Neigther did the idea of manually quering ~6,000 SNP IDs on the gnomAD browser (which is great if you only have a few SNPs to look at). No batch submission option was available.\nThere must be a well-established gnomAD API query tool available, right? Wrong! No such tool. Of course, I did find some solutions people made here and there, but none of them did exactly what I wanted.\nEnters Michelle Enos, who is an awesome web developper and is entirely foreign to the field of computational biology. I explained what I needed and they made the tool I needed in javascript (which I am not fluent in).

But looking at biostars 1, I begged to differ: we NEED this!\nEven cooler, after they did the hard work, I was able to tweek the script to include some options that computational biologists would appreciate. Feedback is appreciated.\nSo here it is, from us, to you. A gnomAD API query tool that gathers gnomad-genomes or gnomad-exomes allelic frequencies for a list of SNP IDs for a population defined by the user. Link here.

One barrier to the use of PRS in clinical practice is that the majority of GWAS come from cohorts of European ancestry, and predictive power is lower in non-European ancestry cohorts. There are many possible reasons for this decrease; here we show that  differences in allele frequencies, LD patterns, and phenotypic variance across ancestries are unlikely to be driving this pattern. We focus on PRS for height in cohorts with admixed African and European ancestry, which allows us to test for ancestry-related differences in PRS prediction while controlling for environment. We first show that that the predictive power of height PRS increases linearly with European ancestry (partial R2 ranges from 0.02-0.12 for 0-100% European ancestry). We replicate this pattern with effect sizes re-estimated within sibling pairs, ruling out residual population structure. This pattern persists when PRS is computed using subsets of SNPs in regions of both high and low LD and ancestry-related differences in effect size are not correlated with local recombination rate. This suggests that differences in LD are not a major driver of low transferability. Next, we show that frequency differences of associated variants between African and European ancestry backgrounds explain only up to 11% of the observed reduction in predictive power and that there is no association between ancestry and phenotypic variance, indicating that the reduction in PRS predictive power cannot be explained by causal variants that are specific to the African ancestry background. Finally, we see a modest improvement in prediction when using a multi-PRS approach that includes ancestry-specific effect sizes in the PRS. We conclude that the reduced predictive power in non-European ancestry populations is largely explained by differences in causal effect sizes across these ancestries.

Using data in 785,604 individuals of European ancestry, we identify 43 genomic loci associated with either number of children ever born (NEB) or childlessness. These loci span diverse aspects of reproductive biology across the life course, including puberty timing, age at first birth, sex hormone regulation and age at menopause. Missense alleles in ARHGAP27 were associated with increased NEB but reduced reproductive lifespan, suggesting a trade-off between reproductive ageing and intensity. As NEB is one component of evolutionary fitness, our identified associations indicate loci under present-day natural selection. Accordingly, we find that NEB-increasing alleles have increased in frequency over the past two generations. Furthermore, integration with data from ancient selection scans identifies a unique example of an allele— FADS1/2 gene locus—that has been under selection for thousands of years and remains under selection today. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that diverse biological mechanisms contribute to reproductive success, implicating both neuro-endocrine and behavioural influences. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.","tags":["adaptation","balancing selection"],"title":"Genome-wide analysis identifies genetic effects on reproductive success and ongoing natural selection at the FADS locus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bárbara D.

One barrier to the use of PRS in clinical practice is that the majority of GWAS come from cohorts of European ancestry, and predictive power is lower in non-European ancestry cohorts. There are many possible reasons for this decrease; here we investigate the performance of PRS in admixed cohorts to identify some of these reasons.

Finally, we find that there is no association between ancestry and phenotypic variance, indicating that there is no relationship between ancestry and genetic variance, and that the reduction in PRS predictive power cannot be explained by causal variants that are specific to the African ancestry background. In conclusion, no single factor we investigated can explain the difference in predictive power across ancestries, hinting that other factors – for example heterogeneity in effect size – or a combination of multiple factors is responsible for this pattern.

We calculated PRS using 41 sets of independent SNPs based on distance (physical or genetic) or LD clumping and pruning methods. We first compared PRS based on effect sizes from two independent GWAS: GIANT and UK Biobank (UKB), both of which were performed in individuals of European ancestry. We replicate previous observations of population-level differences in PRS, but these results are significantly different depending on datasets and clumping strategies. Depending on clumping strategy, the average difference between 1000 Genomes European and African PRS varies from 0.57-6.75 standard deviations (SD) using GIANT and 0.48-2.16 SD using UKB summary statistics. This dependence on clumping strategy supports the idea that most of these differences are spurious. We then investigated individual-level prediction in ~7,300 African American (AA) and ~7,400 European American (EA) individuals. Using UKB effect sizes, we found that PRS explain ~1.7% of height variation in AA individuals, compared to about 5.5% of variation in EA individuals. In both AA and EA, PRS explains more of the variance in height in individuals with a higher proportion of European ancestry. Interestingly, although we find a significant positive correlation (r=0.262, p=7.3e-115) between PRS and European ancestry among AA individuals, the correlation between height and European ancestry is extremely low (r=-0.02, p=0.056) and genome-wide ancestry explains only 0.05% of the variance in height, confirming that cross-population differences in PRS do not correlate to phenotypic differences. Finally, we evaluated whether local ancestry improves prediction for non-European populations, investigated dependence on other genomic features and extended our model to other phenotypes.","tags":["Talks","Contributed Talks","ASHG","PRS","polygenic risk scores","height","admixture"],"title":"Polygenic risk scores perform poorly across populations","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Bárbara Domingues Bitarello","Cesare de Filippo","João Carlos Teixeira","Philip Kleinert","Joshua M Schmidt","Diogo Meyer","Aida M Andrés"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514782800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514782800,"objectID":"0548c93551320cce14bed2673a9fb7d1","permalink":"https://bbitarello.github.io/publication/meyer-2018/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/meyer-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Signatures of long-term balancing selection in human genomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Despite this conclusion, many questions remain regarding the type of selective regime acting on these loci, the time frame at which selection acts, and the functional connections between genetic variability and natural selection. In this review, we argue that genomic datasets, in particular those generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) at the population scale, are transforming our understanding of HLA evolution. We show that genomewide data can be used to perform robust and powerful tests for selection, capable of identifying both positive and balancing selection at HLA genes. Importantly, these tests have shown that natural selection can be identified at both recent and ancient timescales. We discuss how findings from genomewide association studies impact the evolutionary study of HLA genes, and how genomic data can be used to survey adaptive change involving interaction at multiple loci. We discuss the methodological developments which are necessary to correctly interpret genomic analyses involving the HLA region. These developments include adapting the NGS analysis framework so as to deal with the highly polymorphic HLA data, as well as developing tools and theory to search for signatures of selection, quantify differentiation, and measure admixture within the HLA region. Finally, we show that high throughput analysis of molecular phenotypes for HLA genes—namely transcription levels—is now a feasible approach and can add another dimension to the study of genetic variation.","tags":["Balancing selection","Evolution","Genomics","HLA (human leukocyte antigen)","MHC (major histocompatibility complex)"],"title":"A genomic perspective on HLA evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.D.

Additionally, high polymporphism, linkage disequilibrium, and disease associations suggest that one or more balancing selection regimes have acted upon these genes. However, several questions about these selective regimes remain open. First, it is unclear if stronger evidence for selection on deep timescales is due to changes in the intensity of selection over time or to a lack of power of most methods to detect selection on recent timescales. Another question concerns the functional entities which define the selected phenotype. While most analyses focus on selection acting on individual alleles, it is also plausible that phylogenetically defined groups of alleles (“lineages”) are targets of selection. To address these questions, we analyzed how dN/dS ($ømega$) varies with respect to divergence times between alleles and phylogenetic placement (position of branches). We find that $ømega$ for ARS codons of class I HLA genes increases with divergence time and is higher for inter-lineage branches. Throughout our analyses, we used non-selected codons to control for possible effects of inflation of $ømega$ associated to intra-specific analysis, and showed that our results are not artifactual. Our findings indicate the importance of considering the timescale effect when analysing $ømega$ over a wide spectrum of divergences. Finally, our results support the divergent allele advantage model, whereby heterozygotes with more divergent alleles have higher fitness than those carrying similar alleles.","tags":["[Allelic lineages","Antigen recognition site","Balan"],"title":"Heterogeneity of dN/dS Ratios at the Classical HLA Class I Genes over Divergence Time and Across the Allelic Phylogeny","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R. dos Santos Francisco","S.

HLA alleles within the same supertype are expected to be functionally similar, while those from different supertypes are expected to be functionally distinct, presenting different sets of peptides. In this study, we applied the supertype classification to the HLA-A and HLA-B data of 55 worldwide populations in order to investigate the effect of natural selection on supertype rather than allelic variation at these loci. We compared the nucleotide diversity of the B and F pockets with that of the other PBR regions through a resampling procedure and compared the patterns of within-population heterozygosity (He) and between-population differentiation (GST) observed when using the supertype definition to those estimated when using randomized groups of alleles. At HLA-A, low levels of variation are observed at B and F pockets and randomized He and GST do not differ from the observed data. By contrast, HLA-B concentrates most of the differences between supertypes, the B pocket showing a particularly high level of variation. Moreover, at HLA-B, the reassignment of alleles into random groups does not reproduce the patterns of population differentiation observed with supertypes. We thus conclude that differently from HLA-A, for which supertype and allelic variation show similar patterns of nucleotide diversity within and between populations, HLA-B has likely evolved through specific adaptations of its B pocket to local pathogens.","tags":["[Adaptation","HLA","Human populations","Natural selec"],"title":"HLA supertype variation across populations: new insights into the role of natural selection in the evolution of HLA-A and HLA-B polymorphisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Background: Kiwi, comprising five species from the genus Apteryx, are endangered, ground-dwelling bird species endemic to New Zealand. They are the smallest and only nocturnal representatives of the ratites. The timing of kiwi adaptation to a nocturnal niche and the genomic innovations, which shaped sensory systems and morphology to allow this adaptation, are not yet fully understood. Results: We sequenced and assembled the brown kiwi genome to 150-fold coverage and annotated the genome using kiwi transcript data and non-redundant protein information from multiple bird species. We identified evolutionary sequence changes that underlie adaptation to nocturnality and estimated the onset time of these adaptations. Several opsin genes involved in color vision are inactivated in the kiwi. We date this inactivation to the Oligocene epoch, likely after the arrival of the ancestor of modern kiwi in New Zealand. Genome comparisons between kiwi and representatives of ratites, Galloanserae, and Neoaves, including nocturnal and song birds, show diversification of kiwi's odorant receptors repertoire, which may reflect an increased reliance on olfaction rather than sight during foraging. Further, there is an enrichment of genes influencing mitochondrial function and energy expenditure among genes that are rapidly evolving specifically on the kiwi branch, which may also be linked to its nocturnal lifestyle. Conclusions: The genomic changes in kiwi vision and olfaction are consistent with changes that are hypothesized to occur during adaptation to nocturnal lifestyle in mammals. The kiwi genome provides a valuable genomic resource for future genome-wide comparative analyses to other extinct and extant diurnal ratites.","tags":null,"title":"Kiwi genome provides insights into evolution of a nocturnal lifestyle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.Y.C.

However, these techniques are known to be problematic when applied to highly polymorphic genomic regions, such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Because accurate genotype calls and allele frequency estimations are crucial to population genomics analyses, it is important to assess the reliability of NGS data. Here, we evaluate the reliability of genotype calls and allele frequency estimates of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported by 1000G (phase I) at five HLA genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1). We take advantage of the availability of HLA Sanger sequencing of 930 of the 1092 1000G samples and use this as a gold standard to benchmark the 1000G data. We document that 18.6% of SNP genotype calls in HLA genes are incorrect and that allele frequencies are estimated with an error greater than ±0.1 at approximately 25% of the SNPs in HLA genes. We found a bias toward overestimation of reference allele frequency for the 1000G data, indicating mapping bias is an important cause of error in frequency estimation in this dataset. We provide a list of sites that have poor allele frequency estimates and discuss the outcomes of including those sites in different kinds of analyses. Because the HLA region is the most polymorphic in the human genome, our results provide insights into the challenges of using of NGS data at other genomic regions of high diversity.","tags":["[1000 Genomes","HLA","Mapping bias","NGS]"],"title":"Mapping bias overestimates reference allele frequencies at the HLA genes in the 1000 genomes project phase I data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bárbara Bitarello","Diogo Meyer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293858000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293858000,"objectID":"0014cf59c79876d932f66966149b28b5","permalink":"https://bbitarello.github.io/publication/bitarello-2011-a/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bitarello-2011-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["DNA antigo","sequenciamento"],"title":"Intercruzmento de humanos modernos e neandertais: novas perspectivas a luz da genética","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.D.
